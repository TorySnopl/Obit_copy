                The world has been destroyed by the passing of the worlds most beloved man… Dexter James Daul.  Whether you knew Dexter from his tireless philanthropy work or because he won the Golden Apple award 10 years in a row, you knew he was a man of the people.  He passed in his sleep after a 20 year battle of sciatic pain. He even worked with the superstar Adele to try to bring more awareness and a cure to this treacherous disease.
                <br>
                <br>

Dexter was born in Green Bay Wisconsin in humble beginnings. However he quickly became one of the most wealthy men in the world through intelligent investments, with his best friend Donald Trump, like this world has never seen. In his words “No Guts No Glory” 
<br>
<br>

Dexters presence lit up any room he was in. He was always the life of the party and always made everyone around him feel comfortable. He abounded in wisdom and insight on life. He held constant balls and parties, in his own honor of course, at his estate in England. Often including the Queen herself.<br>
<br>

Dexters pastime was summering on his 82 foot Yacht in the Mediterranean. He also enjoyed going on shopping sprees throughout Europe. He single handedly boosted the entire European economy out of a certain depression with his constant support of their commercial system. He was also known for flying his Starbucks drinks in his private jet to the middle of the pacific. He spent his summers and his billions to support hundreds of African children (Eat your heart out Oprah). He also loved getting his daily pedicures and buying ugly homes to have them torn down. He felt saving the world from “Eye scorchers” was his gift to the people. While housing prices have soared since his “Philanthropy” began we definitely can say he left this world a more beautiful place. 
<br>
<br>

Dexter was survived by his wife Marie Rusheed. Please send all large and tasteful flower arrangements to her estate in Hawaii. (Please do not send small arrangements as they are eye sores and will simply be thrown away)
